A clone of Gravity Duck using the SDL2 library, written in C++. Gravity Duck is a 2D puzzle-platformer game where players control a duck with the unique ability to manipulate gravity to overcome obstacles and traps in each level.
In the original game there were 40 levels, but in this version I could only make 15 levels and omitted some details because it was beyond my ability.

### 2.1.1 Movement
Control the duck using the key left key right and space. Use left and right arrows if gravity is currently pointing up or down, up or down arrows if gravity is pulling to the left and right.

The space button will change the gravity of the duck, if the gravity is down it will reverse and so on.
